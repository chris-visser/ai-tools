# AI Tools for web developers

Below is a list of AI tools that I've demonstrated during my Lunch and Learn session at Passionate People. The tools are easy to use and free for the most part.

Feel free to share, copy, commit changes or add new things.

## Code completion
Alternatives to [Github Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot)

- [Tabnine](https://www.tabnine.com/) is a VSCode plugin that uses AI to suggest code. It's a partially free
- [Intellicode](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/services/intellicode/) another free VSCode plugin from Microsoft
- [Webstorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/webstorm/auto-completing-code.html) This is not AI driven, but since Webstorm is an IDE, it is smartly suggesting code and often has a better understanding on methods and properties that can be used. It does not suggest new code though

## Code assistents

- [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat) helps in a number of ways
  - Ask it to describe a function or lines of code
  - Ask it to refactor a function to make it more readable
  - Ask it to add useful code comments
  - Ask it to generate a migration based on a Typescript type
  - Ask it to give an example of ... code
